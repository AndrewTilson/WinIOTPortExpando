# WinIOTPortExpando
Library for windows IOT Raspberry Pi for MCP23008, MCP23017, 595N, and 165N

The 595N and 165N shift register logic is fully functional with a example project tested on a raspberry pi 2.

Working next on the MCP I2c chips.

If anyone is interested in participating i am open to pull request's. If there are request's for additional functionality to any IC's that pertain to port expansion provide a feature request and i will take a look at it.
